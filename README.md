# api

The easiest way ever to create an awesome API... no, really. It's as simple as:

```shell
$ npm install api -g
$ api init
[ Edit files]
$ api deploy
```

There's a bunch of stuff below, but seriously... just run those commands above, and see how simple it is!

## Usage

With npm:
```
npm install api -g
```

With yarn:
```
yarn global add api
```

This gives you the `api` command line program

```sh
# Displays usage information
api

# In a fresh directory
api init
```
